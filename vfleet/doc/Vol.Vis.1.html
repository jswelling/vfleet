<h3>Surface Rendering</h3> <p>
<ul>
<li>Surface rendering is the "usual" type of rendering.
<li>Data is converted to geometrical primitives, which are then drawn.
<li>Everything you see is a 2D surface, embedded in a 3D space.
<li>The conversion to geometrical primitives may lose or disguise 
some data.
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Volume Rendering</h3>
<ul>
<li>Data consists of one or more (supposedly continuous) fields in 3D.
<li>A <b>Transfer Function</b> maps the data into a volume of RGBA 
values.
<li>This volume is rendered directly, like a blob of colored jello.
<li>So, it's a <b>very</b> different kind of process from surface 
rendering.
<li>Data is seen more directly; less likely to be hidden.
<li>Typically, volume rendering can handle larger datasets (above 
64x64x64), but works less well with very small datasets.
</ul>
