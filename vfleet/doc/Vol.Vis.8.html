<h1>Ray Casting</h1>
<hr>
<p>
<i>Ray casting</i> is a backward rendering method.
<p>
<ul>
<li>For each screen 
<i>pixel</i>, a ray is shot into the sample volume. Color and opacity 
are numerically integrated along the ray, until it leaves the volume 
or reaches an opacity of 1.0. The resulting opacity and color are 
assigned to the pixel.<p>

Accuracy of numerical integration is one factor affecting rendering 
time and image accuracy.
<ul>
<li>Ideally, you can step along the ray by small increments, using the 
trilenearly interpolated color and opacity at each sample point.
<li>Alternately, take bigger steps and assume color and opacity are 
constant within a voxel.
</ul>
<li>In general, one ray per pixel is enough (unlike ray tracing of 
surface data). 
<li>Ray casting is accurate but slow.  Tricks to speed it up:
<ul>
<li>Skip empty or constant parts of the volume.
<li>Stop before opacity reaches 1.0.
<li>Adaptive sampling of screen.
</ul>
<li><em>Shear-Warp</em> algorithms are a way to accelerate ray casting
by shearing the volume so the ray stepping algorithm is simple, then
warping the resulting image to correct for the effects of the shear.
</ul>
