<H1>VFleet Distributed Volume Renderer</H1>

VFleet is a volume renderer, which is a program that produces color images 
from 3D volumes of data.  This program can run either locally or in a 
distributed mode, meaning that it farms the work out over a network of
workstations or a parallel computer.  The operation of the user interface 
is pretty much identical in either case.  It is intended for use in 
computational science, in that it can handle very large datasets 
representing multiple variables within the same physical system.
<p>
The rendering modules of VFleet will run on any Unix platform.  The
 user interface requires a Unix platform running Motif.  The distributed
version requires that 
<A HREF="http://www.epm.ornl.gov/pvm/pvm_home.html">PVM</A>
is also installed.  
<a href=/general/software/packages/pvm/pvm.html>Here</a> is the PSC's
PVM documentation.
<p>
VFleet is intended to be installed and run at your site.
<p>
VFleet was developed at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center with major
support from the <a href=http://zeus.ncsa.uiuc.edu:8080/GC3_Home_Page.html>
Grand Challenge Cosmology Consortium</a>.<p>

<p>
This software is currently at release 1.1.  Improvements since the previous
release include:
<ul>
<li>volume masking
<li>optional trilinear interpolation
<li>optional 3D mipmapping
<li>better camera control
<li>more complete scripting support
</ul>
