<h1>Splatting</h1>
<hr>
<p>
<i>Splatting</i> (Westover '89) is a forward rendering algorithm.
<p>
<ul>
<li>In the object space, go from the back of the grid to the front. (Front 
to back will also work).
<li>For each <i>voxel</i> composite a <i>splat</i> onto the screen. The 
splat is a generic footprint (usually from a table) whose color and 
opacity vary with the values for the voxel being dealt with.<p>

This sort of pattern might be used to represent a circular splat. Splat 
shapes are fairly arbitrary; in theory they should have a sort of 
Gaussian shape.
<li>The splat table values multiply the color and opacity of the voxel 
being composited onto the screen.
<li>Note that the shape and size of the splat varies with the 
transformation from object space to image space.
<li>Splat size (and blurring) increases as the number of image pixels 
relative to the dataset dimensions.
<li>It's rather like throwing colored snowballs at the screen.
</ul>
