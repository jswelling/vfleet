<i>Opacity</i> is a material property that prevents light from 
passing through the object. 
<p>
<ul>
<li>By convention, opacity (alpha) ranges 
from 0.0 to 1.0, 1.0 being completely opaque.
<li>The local gradient of opacity can be used to detect surfaces, and as 
the normal for the lighting equation.
<li>Multiple layers of material are composited according to their 
opacity.

<li>An ideal, continuous material takes the limit of this process as it 
goes to an infinite number of infinitely thin layers (exponentials).
</ul>
